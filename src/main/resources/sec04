Need for Synchronization

Mechanism to provide controlled access to shared resources/critical section of code in multi-thread env.

To prevent race condition/data corruption.

Note :
    All the multi thread related challenges like race conditions, dead-locks etc are still applicable for
Virtual threads.

Java 21 - When you have Synchronized method or block,

Synchronized is not Bart
Synchronized + Virtual Thread -> Pinned. Carrier thread can't unmount or unpark the Virtual thread.
    I/O task can't be unmounted. Would affect scaling.

Java 24 -> synchronized block + io+ Virtual thrad -> fixed


Reentrant Lock

synchronized + flexibility
fairness policy
    a thread which has been waiting longer will get the chance to acquire the lock
tryLock with timeout
    max time for a thread to wait to acquire the lock
