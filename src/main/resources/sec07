Future :

Future method is place holder for service calls.

You get values from Future.get() - Waiting for callable to complete and getting the response.

future.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS) -> Timeout after 2 sec

future.cancel(true) -> It interrupt the thread.


Aggregator

Aggregates the response of future.

In getProductDTO () - It has two Submit calls meaning it creates two threads and then we have future method. It means it blocks further execution.


// var rating = Client.getRating(id); You could have done that but It is better to void because some people
//return new ProductDTO(id, product.get(), Client.getRating(id)); //If they do this then Rating call will happen only after product service call\


ExecutorService

Platform threads -> Singe/fixed/cache/scheduled/fork-join-pool (CPU intensive task)
Virtual Threads -> Thread per task executor, non-bloclking benefits behind the scene
