Structured concurrency :-

This is preview feature - 5th preview

JDK 26 - 6th preview..

May be 27??

Just to give high level idea..

What is it?

- A big task with multiple steps, Can be divided to small steps and it can be executed concurrently with virtual thread.

A Programming apprach where a set of related subtasks, runnning in different threads are treated as single unit.


Executor Service :

Unstructured concurrency -
    Utillity for managing a pool of threads and submitting tasks to them.
    Tasks are independent. No built in relationship

We have to manually manage lifcycle, errors, cancellation

But structured concurrency does it for us

Step 1 : choose a joiner strategy
    Joiner is an interface that defines how subtasks complete
        We can also provide custom strategy


        Joiner.allSuccessfullOrThrow() // all must succeed.
        Joiner.anySuccessfulResultOrthrow() // at least one is success
        Joiner.awaitAll() //sucess failer wait for all



Step 2 : Fork Subtasks/Submit work

User StructuredTaskScope instance using open method. Provide Joiner.

scope.join() - depends on joiner strategy..



Scoped Valie Propagation :
There is no inheritable scoped value.. If there is two child threads?
