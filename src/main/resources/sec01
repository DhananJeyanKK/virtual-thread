Virtual Thread
    public Thread (Platform thread)
        abstract BaseVirtualThread
           (package private) VirtualThread

Thread is a public class but VirtualThread is package private - We can't create VirtualThread

Thread.Builder
    Thread.ofPlatform()
    Thread.ofVirtual()

VirtualThreads are daemon thread by default. We can't create non-daemon virtual threads.

We can't create 50K platform threads but I was able to create 50k Virtual threads.
It was able to create 200K virtual threads. It was even possible to create 1000K.

How Virtual thread works?
    It's an illusion provided by Java.
    OS can't see them/Schedule them.
    It looks like a thread, accept runnable. We can thread.start(), thread.join()


    Virtual Threads are not platform threads - Virtual threads are tiny objects. These are task.
    All these Virtual threads are added to queue.
    All this virtual threads are executed by Platform thread from the queue.
    When the Virtual threads are getting executed by Platform thread, If the platform thread
    sees that it is calling a network or thread.sleep - it parks the Virtual thread and start with other
    Virtual thread task.

    A Virtual Thread has to be mounted to the Platform thread or Carrier thread to execute the task.
    When it Parks, the Virtual Thread will be unmounted and goes to Parking.

    When a network call is done for the Parked one - It will unpark the thread and executes again.

    The Platform thread which is executing Virtual threads are called Carrier Thread.

            Virtual Threads fork-join pool. (not a common pool)

How about Stack memory?

Platform threads have fixed stack (1mb, 2mb)
Virtual threads do Not have fixed stack. They have resizable stack.
    Stack Chunk Object.

Each Virtual thread has its Stack chunk object - Its part of heap.

        Heap Memory..........

        VT1 VT2 VT3...            VT5              VT6
                                  Stack Object5    Stack Object 6


             VT7       Platform thread  [Stack Memory of Platform thread]
                       ..               [Stacks VT7 stacks and then when it parks attach it to Heap].
                       ..
                       ...
                       Executes VT7
