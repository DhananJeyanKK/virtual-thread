Virtual thread scheduler

Platform threads are scheduled by the OS scheduler

Virtual Threads are scheduled by JVM
    Dedicated ForkJoinPool to schedule Virtual Threads

Then Carrier Thread pickup this thread.

Virtual Thread Scheduler Config
    Dedicated ForkJoinPool to schedule Virtual threads
        core pool size = available processor
        Carrier threads will not be blocking during I/O


Scheduling Types
    Preemptive
    Cooperative

Preemptive - OS Scheduler uses this
    CPU is allocated for a limited period of time
    OS can forcibly pause a running thread to give CPU to another thread
    Based on thread-priority, time-slice, availability of thread-to-run threads etc.
    Platform threads can have priorities (Thread.setPriority(6))
        1 is low priority
        10 is high
        5 is default
    Note
        Preemptive scheduling behaviour is platform dependent
        Virtual threads have default priority. Can not be modified.

Cooperative
    CPU is allocated till the execution is completed
        or Thread should be willing to give CPU to another thread (Thread.yield())
    Execution is not interrupted
    If there is a long running thread/task, other threads might have to starve.

CPU intensive task - We should prefer Platform threads. Why? because If you use Virtual thread,
The processor gets blocked until it is completed.

Virtual Threads are good for I/O.

Thread.yield - It's yielding an option to another thread for cooperative scheduling.
