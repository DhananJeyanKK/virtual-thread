Scalability :

How application behaves with larger number of requests/Concurrent workloads.

CPU 4 threads can handle.

1. first 4 request proessed by CPU - response time 1s
2. 5th request waiting because of CPU busy - response time 2s
3. 9th request waiting because 5th to 8 busy with CPU - response time 3s

How to process then 1000 requests?

How can I process 1000 requests concurrently in a server application?

    Increase the number of threads? (Platform) - 1000
        Needs memory allocation, context switch
    If we assume we have lots of I/O calls, CPU might not be utilized. But increasing threads will consume mem.
        cpu 10%
        memory 1GB


Factor that could affect scalaibility of app
    Resources (CPU, memeory, network, disc etc)
    Application design/arch (Data structure, DB query etc)


How to measure or what is metric that our app is scaling or not.
    Throughput
    Response time


Throughput - Number of request a server can process per unit time (N req/sec, N req/min).
Response time - Time taken to process request.

Response time and throughput has inverse relationship.

Throughput - Y axis
Response time - X axis

Upto 4 request - response time remians 1s
When increasing 5th request - through put is same 4 can be processed at a time - response time goes to 2s
