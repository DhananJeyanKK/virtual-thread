CompletableFuture :

Intro in java 8

Asynch programming in declarative style

Nice way to handle errors.

We have Future<V>, its an interface

CompletableFuture is a class which implements Future. It has lot of methods to handle error, combine results etc.

We can extend this class to override.

CompletableFuture by default it uses Fork-Join-Pool.
    It accepts an executor. We can use Virtual thread per task executor.


Is CompletableFuture reactive?
    It's not.
    It's not same as reactive programming

Completable Future

method-1 ------> method-2
         result
         <------

Result is put it in box, Why?
If method 2, time consuming IO task, Sends Completablefuture object (something like pipe),


If you have Completablefuture box returned - You can use it in main method.
cf.thenAccept - main method doesn't block proceed further
cf.join - main thread get blocked.

Completablefuture can use factor - it is using Fork-join-pool.

RunAsynch - Pass Virtual thread.

Supply Asynch - Supply value asynchronously.



Summary :

A tool/class which implements future interface lot of methods process/combine result in functional style
It uses fork-join pool
We can use virtual thread per task exectuor for IO tasks

Limitation,
It implements future, but cancel method doesnt interuppt the thread running task.
