Limitations :


Concurrency Limit :

Virtual Threads are not supposed to be pooled.

Fixed Thread Pools are like - Creates 10 threads and same threads reuse.


Semaphore : Synchronized or Reentrant lock.

Use Semaphore for limiting the thread.

You can configure to allow number of thread permits.

Semaphore  semaphore = new Semaphore(3)
semaphore.acquire() // locking
code.execute();
semaphore.release();


Semaphore(1) is equal to ReentrantLock() ?

Lock -> The Thread which acquired the lock is supposed to unlock

Semaphore -> Any thread can release the permit.

Sometimes one thread gets all permits in order to execute its own thread not to interferre with other threads.

Virtual Thread Concurrency Limiter :-
You can achive only by Semaphore.

The order is not maintained here.. randomly calls the services.
This is solved using Java Queue - Put it in queue and poll it when needed.

Gatherers :

It's not available for primitive streams.

Using MapConcurrent - We don't have to use semaphore - It can easily be used.
