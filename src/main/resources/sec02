Platform Thread..

My Machine is 12 cores - If you have 12 task to do, then each CPU processor will pickup the thread.
Scheduler assigns the thread to each CPU.

Let say we have 24 task -> The scheduler assigns 2 threads per CPU and it doesn't wait for the thread
to complete. That's why You will see each thread process time has increased.

Virtual Thread..

My Machine is 12 cores - If you have 12 task to do, then each CPU processor will pickup the Virtual
Thread task.
Scheduler assigns the thread task to each CPU and it is executed by 12 Carrier thread.

Let say we have 24 task -> 24 Virtual threads will be created in the heap.
Then 12 carrier threads pickup the Virtual threads task and start to execute. It complete the task and
then proceed
with another Virtual thread task.


Conclusion : If your application is only CPU intensive process, then Virtual thread migration doesn't
impact anything.
The time taken is same.

If there is lot of IO, network involved then Virtual thread makes difference.
